# Pluto Rover

Pluto Rover is an exercise where the idea is to create a X by Y grid where a vehicle can move around using the following instructions:

1. help -> Will display all the possible instructions rover can take
2. f -> Moves rover forwards
3. b -> Moves rover backwards
4. l -> Moves rover in 90degrees to the left (not leaving is current position)
5. r -> Moves rover in 90degrees to the right (not leaving is current position)
6. h -> Will display all the successfull instructions rover has done so far.
7. q -> Aborts mission

This grid can have obstacles in it and once this rover encounters one it should stop and report the obstacle.

Notes: Have fun with it like I had.
